# ðŸª“ Root Check

The **Malloc Security SDK** offers a comprehensive root detection feature that checks for common indicators of a rooted device. This includes known rooting binaries, packages, superuser access, and modified security properties.

> This operation is available in both synchronous and asynchronous versions (with callbacks).

---

## âœ… Asynchronous Usage (Recommended)

####  Java
```java
MallocSDK.rootCheckAsync(new MallocSDK.ScanFinishedCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onScanFinished(JSONObject rootCheckResults) {
        // Use the rootCheckResults
    }
});
```

---

## âš¡ Synchronous Usage

> Do **not** call this on the main/UI thread.

####  Java
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.execute(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        JSONObject rootCheckResults = MallocSDK.rootCheckSync();
        // Use the rootCheckResults
    }
});
executor.shutdown();
```

## ðŸ§  Notes

- `rooted_flag`: A high-level boolean flag indicating if the device appears to be rooted.
- `root_check_results`: A list of all individual root checks performed, with their respective results and descriptions.
- If `rooted_flag` is `true`, your app may choose to restrict certain actions or warn the user.

---

## ðŸ”’ Best Practices

- Always perform root checks **after SDK initialization** is completed.
- Use the **asynchronous** version for better UI performance.
