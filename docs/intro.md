# Welcome to Malloc Security SDK

The **Malloc Security SDK** empowers Android developers to seamlessly integrate **privacy protection**, **threat detection**, and **real-time device monitoring** into their applications — all with minimal effort and maximum impact.

## 🛡️ Key Features

- **Microphone & Camera Access Detection**
- **Clipboard Monitoring**
- **Device Threat Detection**
- **Custom Security Alerts**
- **Minimal Permissions Required**
- **Lightweight & Battery-Friendly**

## ⚙️ How It Works

The SDK hooks into Android system components using secure and efficient techniques to identify:

Once integrated, your app can monitor threats in real time and act accordingly — either by alerting users, restricting access, or logging threats for review.
